We decided that we should work with the software requirement document 
on Monday after lunch, if there is a lecture that is otherwise we'll 
start at 10. 
The time allocation plan will be done by Sebastian and Vamsi since 
they are working on the project plan already. 
Sebastian will assemble a small list with milestones that we will use, 
nothing fanzy but just something to go by. 
We should all report that we have worked 20 hours this week with a 
short line what we have done, should be mailed to Sebastian so he can 
assemble a list. 
Henrik will be absent the next week so he said that he would start 
looking/writing use cases during the weekend.
