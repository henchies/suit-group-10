This was the meeting with Per, when he finally showed up. 
Due to the problems with the groups the submission deadlines that has 
passed will be moved to this afternoon (thursday) 
Per also said that we can just do a part of one component due to the 
time limit. 
In the project plan we can remove the "change planning" and "Quality 
plan" can be removed. 
When the project directives are submitted the one submitted it will
get an OK in studieportalen, nothing will be sent to the whole group. 
The deadline for the project plan is the 5th 23:00 but that's
according to our internal deadline so it will be done by then. 
Per also wants a time schedule attached to the project plan, Sebastian â€¨is working on that. 
All the use cases that we want to implement we should write text and
flow charts and so on for. But no need to come up with ones that we don't want to implement. 
We had a question about the headline Design requirement but that was
just a fanzy word for non-functional requirement.
